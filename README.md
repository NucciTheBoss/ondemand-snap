## Important notice about usage

This snap is currently experimental; it is not complete and will likely not work as
I am still developing it. Right now this repository is the staging ground for all
my hacking and wacking on Open OnDemand. If you're interested in the development of
this snap - and want to contribute - please reach out to me on the 
[Ubuntu HPC Matrix space](https://matrix.to/#/#ubuntu-hpc:matrix.org).
